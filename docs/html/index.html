<div class="textblock"><p>Currently the <a class="el" href="classCrownstone.html" title="Crownstone encapsulates all functionality, stack, services, and configuration. ">Crownstone</a> is on Kickstarter! <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dobots/crownstone">Pledge</a> and make open-firmware a thing of the future!</p>
<h1>Indoor Localization with BLE</h1>
<p>This project aims at a wireless network with BLE nodes that use their mutual signal strengths to build up a network with their relative locations. This can be used later by someone carrying a smartphone to establish their location indoors. Everybody say that they can do it, but very few solutions are actually out there. Let's hope we can change that.</p>
<h2>DoBeacon</h2>
<p>The DoBeacon is a simplified <a class="el" href="classCrownstone.html" title="Crownstone encapsulates all functionality, stack, services, and configuration. ">Crownstone</a> which adheres to the iBeacon specification. If you have bought DoBeacons as a developer we would kindly like to refer you to our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17zn5TKdNAjYbNbA6akbSzFV_WQmOnvcjDFT3bwIvGzo/edit#">DoBots SDK Manual</a>. That document explains how to set a different signal strength, advertisement interval, etc.</p>
<h1>Communication</h1>
<p>You can best communicate bugs and feature requests via the <a href="https://github.com/dobots/bluenet/issues">issue tracker</a>. For all other questions, please, feel free to ask us anything on <a href="https://muut.com/dobots">muut</a>.</p>
<h1>Why Bluetooth LE?</h1>
<p>Bluetooth LE (BLE) does not inherently fit a wireless network. We have technology in-house (at the Almende group) that can do this, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MyriaNed">Myrianed</a>, but dedicated solutions are difficult to be accepted in the mainstream. This is also the case for ZigBee, Z-Wave, and other mesh solutions. They will remain marginal unless they get accepted in a common handheld. BLE is not just a random technology, it is of paramount importance to understand this.</p>
<p>That's why BLE is interesting. A lot of phones come with BLE, so a solution is automatically useful to a large variety of people. It is not the best technology for the job. The network topology is a Personal Area Network (PAN), not a Local Area Network (LAN). This means that you cannot have all nodes communicating with all other nodes at the same time. To get RSSI values we will have to set up connections to other nodes and tear them down again. Not very efficient. But it will do the job.</p>
<p>However, through the Timeslot API, it is possible to run a totally different protocol parallel to BLE using the same radio. This means that we can have a mesh network at the same time as providing for BLE functionality. The new S130 SoftDevice adds to that even multiple BLE roles at the same time. So many possibilities arise!</p>
<p>Feel free to clone this repos.</p>
<p>The code base comes from <a href="http://hg.cmason.com/nrf">http://hg.cmason.com/nrf</a>. Thanks a lot Christopher!</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>For installation and configuration, see the https://github.com/dobots/bluenet/blob/master/INSTALL.md "installation instructions".</p>
<h2>Todo</h2>
<p>Things to do are listed in our https://github.com/dobots/bluenet/blob/master/TODO.md "todo list".</p>
<h2>Commercial use</h2>
<p>This code is used in a commercial product at DoBots, the <a href="http://dobots.nl/products/crownstone">Crownstone</a>. Our intellectual property exists on two levels. First, you can license our technology to create these extremely cheap BLE building blocks yourself. Second, we build services around BLE-enabled devices. This ranges from smartphones to <a href="http://dobots.nl/2014/07/15/ble-dobeacon-a-virtual-memo/">gadgets such as the "virtual memo"</a>. What this means for you as a developer is that we can be transparent about the software on the <a class="el" href="classCrownstone.html" title="Crownstone encapsulates all functionality, stack, services, and configuration. ">Crownstone</a>, which is why this repository exists. Feel free to build your own services on top of it, and benefit from our software development as much as you want.</p>
<p>It would be much appreciated to state "DoBots inside" in which case we will be happy to provide support to your organisation.</p>
<p>If you want to buy our hardware, please navigate to our <a href="http://dobots.nl/products/crownstone">website</a>. We offer a hardware development kit for professional use.</p>
