# Bluenet protocol v0.5.0
-------------------------


# Advertisements and scan response
When no device is connected, [advertisements](#ibeacon_packet) will be sent at a regular interval (100ms by default). A device that actively scans, will also receive a [scan response packet](#scan_response_packet). This contains useful info about the state.

### <a name="ibeacon_packet"></a>iBeacon advertisement packet
This packet is according to iBeacon spec, see for example [here](http://www.havlena.net/en/location-technologies/ibeacons-how-do-they-technically-work/).

#### <a name="switch_state_packet"></a>Switch State Packet

To be able to distinguish between switching with relay and switching with PWM, the switch state is a bit struct with
the following layout

![Switch State Packet](docs/diagrams/switch_state_packet.png)

Bit 7 is used for the Relay Flag, where 0 = OFF, 1 = ON
Bits 6-0 are used for PWM, where 100 is full ON, 0 is OFF, dimmed in between

# Services
When connected, the following services are available.

## Power service

The power service has UUID 24f30000-7d10-4805-bfc1-7663a01c3bff.
